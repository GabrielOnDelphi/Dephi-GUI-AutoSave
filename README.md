# GUI-AutoSave

This Delphi application will demonstrate:

  1. How to save the state of all GUI controls on application shutdown and then restore them loaded on application startup:
       * checkboxes
       * radiobuttons
       * cubic custom controls
       * form's position
       * controls on the second form

  2. How to send messages to the AppLog (a app-wide message logging system).

  This demo app requires the LightSaber Core and Log library:
